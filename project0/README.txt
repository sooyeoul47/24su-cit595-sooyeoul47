As a part of MSEDS progrm, I am also looking to learn more computer system and deep conding process in general. I am currently working as SQL developer in legal company usually working with financial clients but never got a chance to learn operating systems. Also, I am using GIT through Azure Devops but never have set up from scratch using terminal which makes me really excited. Thus, It would be really helpful for me in the future to set up new repository for my team. Throughout this course, I would like to learn C language in general since it helps build a foundation for understand more complex programming languages and operating systems.
